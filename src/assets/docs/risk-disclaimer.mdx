## 2. PROTOCOL RISKS
Market and Financial Risks - As with any asset, all aforementioned Astrolab's products, and their underlying DeFi protocols can increase or decrease in return, and can lead to a substantial loss limited to the amount of funds you deposit. Therefore, you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should do your own research and/or seek advice from a financial advisor if you are unclear of any matters. Astrolab does not provide any investment, legal or tax advice and does not assume any liability to third parties with respect to the provision of advice or your transactions in and in connection with Astrolab.

Counterparty Risks - Astrolab and its team do not participate in or act as counterparties to its product transactions and do not offer intermediary services like brokerage or custodianship. Transactions are conducted on a peer-to-contract basis using immutable smart contracts, with no regulatory oversight from Astrolab. These activities are not covered by any investor protection or complaint resolution mechanisms. Users are responsible for adhering to local legal requirements and bear all associated risks. Astrolab has no control over user transactions within its protocols
Astrolab does not provide advisory, execution, or clearing services. Users maintain full custody of their funds in Crates and manage their positions independently.

Asynchronous Liquidity Risks - Astrolab products implement [ERC7540 specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540) for asynchronous withdrawals from applicable products (vaults) in the case of insufficient liquidity. This allows for the processing of withdrawals of any size but does not guarantee instant, block-time liquidity. Redemption requests shall be honored within a maximum delay of 7 days, but will typically be executed in under 48 hours. ERC7540 solves several issues met with the [plain ERC4626 standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/), and allows for more complex structuring of products.

## 3. THIRD-PARTY RISKS
Regulatory Risks - You should ensure that your activities relating to Astrolab, and its products and services, comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements and restrictions you abide by. By carrying out transactions in or in connection with Astrolab products, you warrant that you are authorised to enter into the relevant transactions and that you are acting in compliance with applicable law and regulation. Citizenship amendments are available in [our Terms of Services](https://astrolab.fi/tos).

Oracles Risks - Some of Astrolab's products uses price feeds oracls, namely from Chainlink and Pyth Network. While these services are highly decentralized and fault-tolerant, they carry inherent risks of their own. For more information, please visit:
- Chainlink Terms: https://chain.link/terms
- Pyth Network Disclaimer: https://pyth.network/disclaimer

Cross-Chain Risks - Astrolab cross-chain products and services use relayer networks such as LayerZero and Axelar, and bridge aggregators such as LiFi and Squid Router. These technologies, while proven, decentralized and audited, are still in their early days and carry inherent risks of their own. For more information, please visit:
- LayerZero Terms: https://layerzero.network/terms
- Axelar Terms: https://community.axelar.network/tos
- LiFi Terms: https://li.fi/legal/terms-and-conditions

DeFi Integrations Risks - Astrolab's products involve underlyings that are subject to their own set of operational risks and potential for smart contract technical exploits. These risks, inherent in third-party DeFi protocols, can impact the performance and security of Astrolab's offerings. Users should be aware that interactions with such protocols carry additional layers of risk, including but not limited to vulnerabilities in smart contract code, governance decisions by third-party entities, and varying degrees of decentralization. These factors can lead to scenarios such as loss of funds, reduced returns, or exposure to unforeseen liabilities. It is advisable for users to conduct thorough due diligence and understand the specific risks associated with each underlying protocol involved in Astrolab's strategies.
