# ASTROLAB TERMS OF SERVICE

Last Updated: 3 Jan 2024

Please read these Terms of Service carefully as they form a legally binding contract between you and us.

These terms of service (the "Terms") govern your ("you" or "your") use of the services provided by Astrolab DAO ("Astrolab", "the DAO", "we", "us" or "our") and our team, including [https://astrolab.fi](https://astrolab.fi/) and [https://radyal.xyz](https://radyal.xyz) (the "Application", "App") and any of our other protocols, websites or applications (collectively, the "Services"), and your Wallet (as defined below), and creates a binding contract between you and us.
Astrolab DAO operates the [https://astrolab.fi](https://astrolab.fi) and [https://radyal.xyz](https://radyal.xyz) websites, which act as a front-end to Astrolab DAO's decentralized infrastructure. For clarity, Astrolab does not operate the decentralized infrastructure hosting its smart contracts, nor any entity that could alter smart contracts operations, beyond the Botnet upkeep routines (the Botnet is Astrolab DAO's dedicated keeper network). Within this network, Astrolab DAOâ€™s involvement is strictly limited to non-custodial upkeep activities. The keepers are fully autonomous and have very little control over operated contracts, they are designed to support the platform's health and compute efficiency without holding or managing assets directly, thereby eliminating a DAO specific risk of Denial of Service (DoS) or financial exploit on deployed contracts.

It is crucial to note that while Astrolab has a constrained ability to update, enhance, amend, fix, or otherwise modify the smart contracts, these contracts are primarily immutable to ensure robust security and reliability. However, under narrowly defined conditions, some elements of the smart contracts might be upgradeable or modifiable to meet emerging requirements or to rectify pivotal concerns, in a manner that is transparent and governed by the decentralized decision-making processes of Astrolab DAO.

Any reference to "Wallet" in these Terms shall mean the crypto wallet you use to interact with our Services.
We ask you please read these Terms thoroughly so you properly understand your obligations and your rights in relation to our Services and your Wallet. By installing, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Services, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you breach or violate any of the Terms, we have the right to disable and block your access to the Services immediately.

We can make updates to these Terms at any time and will make any updated versions of the Terms available via the Services. Your continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of the updated Terms. However, if you do not accept the updated Terms, you are no longer permitted to use the Services. We therefore encourage you to regularly review the Terms to ensure you are fully aware of your obligations and rights with regards the Services.
